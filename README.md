Color Guessing Game
===================

A simple color guessing game made with HTML, CSS, and pure vanilla JavaScript. The game displays a random RGB value along with some colored circles and you have to choose which of these circles has the color that corresponds to this RGB value.

The game has an **Easy Mode** and a **Hard Mode**.
In the **Easy Mode**, your choice is limited to three circles.
On the other hand, the **Hard Mode** can be very tricky because you have six available choices.

You can restart the game to generate a new challenge at any point of time and you can play as much times as you want.

Don't worry if you don't get the correct answer at first glance. Keep trying and have fun while improving your intuition for colors, there is no loss!
